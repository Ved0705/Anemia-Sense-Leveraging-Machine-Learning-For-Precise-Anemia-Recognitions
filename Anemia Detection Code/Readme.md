# Anemia Detection Web App using Machine Learning

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts whether a patient is Anemic or Not Anemic using multiple machine learning algorithms trained on healthcare data. It uses a structured dataset with patient health parameters and selects the best model based on accuracy.

## Features

- Multiple ML Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Lasso)
- Model Evaluation with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
- Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimal Performance
- Interactive Web Interface built using Flask
- Organized Codebase with Scalable Structure

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- HTML/CSS
