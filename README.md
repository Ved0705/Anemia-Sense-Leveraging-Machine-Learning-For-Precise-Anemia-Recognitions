**Anemia-Sense: Leveraging Machine Learning for Precise Anemia Recognition** is a health-tech initiative aimed at enhancing the early detection and classification of anemia through intelligent, data-driven methods. Anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, affects millions globally and often goes undiagnosed in early stages due to nonspecific symptoms. This project harnesses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient health data and predict whether an individual is likely to be anemic.

The system is trained on a structured dataset containing various clinical attributes such as hemoglobin levels, RBC count, MCV, and other blood parameters. By applying multiple machine learning models—including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso—the application evaluates their performance and selects the most accurate model for deployment. It also incorporates hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.

Integrated into a user-friendly Flask web application, the model allows users to input relevant health metrics and receive instant predictions. The objective is to assist healthcare professionals and patients by offering a quick, reliable, and accessible decision-support tool. Ultimately, Anemia-Sense demonstrates how artificial intelligence can transform clinical diagnostics by enabling precision, scalability, and proactive intervention.
